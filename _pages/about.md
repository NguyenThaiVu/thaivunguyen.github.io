I am a Master student of Telecommunications at INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, supervised by Prof. [Long Le](https://longbaole.github.io/).

My research interests are in the area of machine learning, tiny machine learning, and its applications such as malware detection. 

Before joining INRS-EMT, I was a teaching assistant at Computer Science department, University of Science, Vietnam National University. I received my B.S. degree from University of Science, Vietnam National University.
